Interview Task
Task:
Write a FastAPI application to store and retrieve metadata from DICOM files.
Requirements:


Set up a FastAPI application:

Use FastAPI to create two endpoints:


POST /: This endpoint will accept a DICOM file, extract the following metadata, and store it in a SQL database:

PatientID
StudyInstanceUID
SeriesInstanceUID
Modality



GET /: This endpoint will allow querying records stored in the database. You should be able to query by the following metadata:

PatientID
StudyInstanceUID
SeriesInstanceUID
Modality







DICOM File Handling:

Use a library like pydicom to parse the DICOM file and extract the metadata.



Database:

Use SQLAlchemy as an ORM for interacting with the database.
Store the DICOM metadata in a relational database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
Use an SQLite database for simplicity, or configure a PostgreSQL database if required.



Use Poetry for Dependency Management:

Create a pyproject.toml file with the required dependencies.




Steps to implement:


Create the FastAPI project:

Initialize a FastAPI app with the required endpoints.
Install dependencies using Poetry.



Database Model Setup:

Define an SQLAlchemy model to store the extracted metadata.



Implement / Endpoint:

Accept the DICOM file.
Parse the file using pydicom to extract PatientID, StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID, and Modality.
Store this data in the SQL database.



Implement / Endpoint:

Allow querying the database using filters for the metadata fields (PatientID, StudyInstanceUID, etc.).
